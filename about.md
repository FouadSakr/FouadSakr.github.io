I'm currently a graduate student at QMUL EECS advised by [Gianni Antichi](https://gianniantichi.github.io/)
. I'm also working with [Brent Stephens](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~brents/)
 at UIC. My interests centers around computer systems, mainly operating systems and networks.

Before joining QMUL, I was a research assistant at SingArch lab of NUS SoC working with [Djordje Jevdjic](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~jevdjic/). I completed my bachelor's and master's degrees at IUST advised by [Mohsen Sharifi](http://webpages.iust.ac.ir/msharifi/).
