title: Alireza? Who?
---

I'm Alireza Sanaee. I'm a graduate student at Queen Mary University of London. [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/99AhZz6PbabrCzXT9) is where I came from.

I'm slowly becoming an eBPF enthusiast and learning about it. I'll be posting about eBPF soon. I'm not too fond of complicated stuff. My hobbies are chess, competitive programming, running, and hiking. By the way, I'm really good at saying empty words for hours, and I just need to find a pair of ears.

I love minimalism and practice it. I probably reuse the concept for the resource management of computers. I'm also planning to learn about Rust this year, there is a lot of buzzword around Rust, not sure how true they are.
