title: Alireza? Who?
---

I'm Alireza Sanaee. I'm a graduate student at Queen Mary Univesrity of London. [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/99AhZz6PbabrCzXT9) is where I come from.

I'm slowly becoming an eBFP enthusiast and learning about it. I'll be posting about eBPF soon. I love doing things in simplistic ways, I actually despise convoluted stuff. I like kernel hacking, competitive programming, and RUNNING.

I love minimalism, and practice it.
