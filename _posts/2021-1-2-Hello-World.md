title: Alireza? Who?
---

I'm Alireza Sanaee. I'm a graduate student at Queen Mary University of London. [Here](https://goo.gl/maps/99AhZz6PbabrCzXT9) is where I came from.

I'm slowly becoming an eBPF enthusiast and learning about it. I'll be posting about eBPF soon. I love doing things in simplistic ways. I'm not too fond of complicated stuff. My hobbies are kernel hacking, competitive programming, running, and hiking. By the way, I'm really good at saying empty words for hours, and I just need to find a pair of ears.

I love minimalism and practice it. I have been practicing it without knowing that it. After a while, I realized that I'm not alone in this. I probably reuse the concept for the resource management of computers.
