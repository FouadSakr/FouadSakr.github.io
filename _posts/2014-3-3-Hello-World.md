title: Alireza? Who?
---

Hello everyone, I'm Alireza Sanaee. I'm mostly interested in networked systems. I'm slowly becoming an eBFP enthusiast and learning about it. I'll be posting about eBPF soon. I love doing things in simplistic ways, I actually despise convoluted stuff. I like kernel hacking, competitive programming, and RUNNING.


I love minimalism, and practice it.
